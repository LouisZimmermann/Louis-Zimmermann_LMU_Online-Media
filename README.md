***Open the website by clicking the index.html file which is the main

Hello and welcome. 
I would like to tell you a bit more about my project and my website. 
I would like to start with the homepage of my website (The index.html file is the homepage of the website, which is the best place to start). Right at the beginning, it should embody what I have learned during this seminar. I tried out various possibilities and tools with HTML and, for example, created my CV in the form of a table. To make the website more visually appealing, I also used many CSS tools. For example, the "Flexbox" to create more exciting layouts and to be able to arrange elements next to each other. A harmonious overall appearance was also achieved with CSS using a coordinated color palette and design language. 

A navigation bar guides website visitors through several subpages that deal with various topics from the seminar. In order to ensure clarity, I decided to combine several classes on one sub-page each - organized according to the main topics.

Introduction: 
On this subpage, I have summarized the basics of the seminar topic: Designing online media and provided an ongoing overview of the evolution of social media. 
You will also find an analysis of Instagram. Instagram is analyzed on behalf of many similar platforms using various categories. As on the homepage of the website, I have also used CSS here to present the content in an appealing way. In addition to this, I also used a graphics program to create an infographic. I then integrated this into the HTML code as an image file. As a beginner in designing online media, this was a practical and feasible way to make my own website even more varied without overwhelming myself with unknown CSS functions.

Frontend+Backend: 
I have worked on the technical/design side in the same way as on the previous pages. In terms of content, you can expect a definition of frontend development and then some important terms and programming languages in this context, which are also visualized using image examples. Some of these are images from my own repertoire, for example screenshots of exercises from the course.â€¨The same applies to the topic of backend development. Important terms are explained in understandable language. In addition, a case study of C++ is followed by an infographic and a link to a PDF with further information, which was the result of group work in the relevant lesson. 

Data:
I have also dedicated a separate subpage to this smaller sub-topic. Here, a distinction is made between data storage and databases, followed by an overview of different types of databases.

Javascript: 
How about a little quiz at the end? In addition to a more precise definition of Javascript, you can try out the possibilities of this programming language with a small quiz that I have integrated.


That's all I have to say, except that I hope you enjoy reading and browsing my website :)
