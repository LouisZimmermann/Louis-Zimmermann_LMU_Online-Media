            <h2>Platform Architecture and Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Platform Architecture and Infrastructure are like the building blocks of the digital world. Imagine you have a computer or a phone (that's the client) and you want to do something, like check your emails. Your device talks to a big computer somewhere else (that's the server), and it fetches the emails for you. This way, your device doesn't have to do all the hard work – it just asks the server to do it.
                Now, the infrastructure is like the roads and bridges that connect your device to that big computer. It ensures that your request and the response from the server can travel smoothly back and forth.
                So, when we talk about client/server architecture, we mean this teamwork between your device (client) and the big computer somewhere else (server). And when we talk about client/server infrastructure, we're talking about all the ways these devices and big computers are connected, like the internet.
